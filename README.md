# WildLifeZoo

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The WildLifeZoo application was a project involving the integration of C++ and Java
I was required to take a functioning Java class, use the JNI C++ header file, and utilize 
the Java functionality in my C++ application. The proble the project itself was solving was to
build the interfacing system for the Wildlife Zoo RFID tracking. I created a user menu, loaded data,
displayed data, added functionality to add record, delete records, and save the data.

# What did you do particularly well?
  Converted the string input from the files into C++ objects
  Had various exception handling cases
  Used file creation and parsing logic quite effectively

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I wonder if I could make my code more modular than I currently have it. If I had more time, that is a route I would have definitely pursued.
  I would also spend more time double checking variables to ensure that only variables that need to be public, are public.
  
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I honestly can't say that I had any "challenges" while working on this assignment. As with anything I worked through the problem, but I believe this is one 
  of the more straight forward and simple projects that we completed this term. On the outside it can seem complex but when you look underneath, you are able to
  see that it is similar to the type of work we have been doing.
  
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  I would say that two skills that are transferable to other projects would be Debugging and my thorough commenting.
  The thing with commenting is that whether or not your solution is effective, it can at least help because you are stating
  what your code is/should be doing. This means if you need help, I find it easier to walk through if the code has been well commented.
  
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I did so by using standard best practices, and focusing on how the code looks to others.
  I also made the effort to thoroughly comment my code to make it easy for people to understand.
